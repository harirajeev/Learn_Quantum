Conclusion and Outlook

Quantum computers are expected to surpass the computational capabilities of classical computers and achieve
disruptive impact on numerous industry sectors, such as global energy and materials, pharmaceuticals and medical
products, telecommunication, travel, logistics, and finance. In particular, the finance sector has a history of
creation and first adaptation of new technologies. This is true also when it comes to quantum computing. In
fact, finance is estimated to be the first industry sector to benefit from quantum computing, not only in the
medium and long terms, but even in the short term, because of the large number of financial use cases that
lend themselves to quantum computing and their amenability to be solved effectively even in the presence of
approximations.

A common misconception about quantum computing is that quantum computers are simply faster processors
and hence speedups will be automatically achieved by porting a classical algorithm from a classical computer
to a quantum one—just like moving a program to a system-upgraded hardware. In reality, quantum computers
are fundamentally different from classical computers, so much so that the algorithmic process for solving an
application has to be completely redesigned based on the architecture of the underlying quantum hardware.
Most of the use cases that characterize the finance industry sector have high computational complexity,
and for this reason they lend themselves to quantum computing. However, the computational complexity of a
problem per se is not a guarantee that quantum computing can make a difference. To assess commercial viability,
we must first answer a couple questions. First, is there in fact any need for improved speed of calculations
or computational-accuracy for the given application? Determining whether there is a gap in what the current
technology can provide us is essential and is a question that financial players typically ask when doing proof
of concept projects. Second, when adapting a classical finance application to quantum computing, can that
application achieve quantum speedup and, if so, when will that happen based on the estimated evolution of the
underlying quantum hardware?

Today’s quantum computers are not yet capable of solving real-life-scale problems in the industry more efficiently and more accurately than classical computers can. Nevertheless, proofs of concept for quantum advantage
and even quantum supremacy have already been provided (see Section 3). There is hope that the situation will
change in the coming years with demonstrations of quantum advantage. It is crucial for enterprises, and particularly financial institutions, to use the current time to become quantum ready in order to avoid being left behind
when quantum computers become operational in a production environment.
We are in the early stages of the quantum revolution, yet we are already observing a strong potential for
quantum technology to transform the financial industry. So far, the community has developed potential quantum
solutions for portfolio optimization, derivatives pricing, risk modeling, and several problems in the realm of
artificial intelligence and machine learning, such as fraud detection and NLP.

In this paper we have provided a comprehensive review of quantum computing for finance, specifically focusing
on quantum algorithms that can solve computationally challenging financial problems. We have described the
current landscape of the state of the industry. We hope this work will be used by the scientific community,
both in industry and in academia, not only as a reference, but also as a source of information to identify new
opportunities and advance the state of the art.
